# Normal-Distribution-Linear-Regression


Used car sales data

Part A

Show the normal distribution of used car prices sample data, and predict the price of a used car depending on it's specifications (i.e regressors/variables). Perform a null hypothesis to find where the mean price falls in the range of prices listed.

Regressors:
1. Brand (relatively expensive or relatively cheap car brand)(Dummy variables for different brands)
2. Mileage (the higher the mileage, the less expensive the car)
3. Engine Volume (sports cars have higher engine volume relative to economy cars)
4.Year of production (the older the car, the cheaper it is)


Part B

Find the linear regression equation using various R functions and operations to verify and 
confirm the linear relationship between used car Prices and the above listed regressors. I used the Anova
frame work of statistics to determine the degree of linearity, correlation, variability, and reliabilty between
the dependent variable of Prices and the above listed regressors (i.e. independent variables)
